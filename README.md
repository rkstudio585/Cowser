   git clone https://github.com/rkstudio585/Cowser
   cd Cowser
   ```
2. Install Dependencies

Install the required Python packages using pip:

pip install -r requirements.txt
```
3. Make the Bash Script Executable

```

Usage üìú

Using the Python Script

Run the cowser.py script with the following commands:

Greet a User
```python
python main.py <user_name>

```
Displays usage instructions and available commands.

List All ASCII Art
```python
python main.py list
```
Lists all available ASCII art options.


Using the Bash Script

Greet a User
```bash
./cowset <user_name>
```
Show Help
```bash
./cowset help
```
List All ASCII Art
```bash
./cowset list
```

Adding More ASCII Art üé®

To add more ASCII art designs:

1. Open main.py.
```python
nano main.py
```

2. Update the show_cows() function with additional ASCII art strings.
